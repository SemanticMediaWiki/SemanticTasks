# Semantic Tasks

Semantic Tasks is an extension to MediaWiki that works in conjunction with Semantic MediaWiki 
to provide task notifications and reminders by email. 

In contrast to the built in notification systems in MediaWiki (watching pages), this extension 
can be used to trigger notifications withour user interaction with the MediaWiki system, e. g. 
by filling in a form (using the PageForms extension) where a user name is entered in a form 
and in the resulting template the respective properties are set to trigger a email 
notification (see below). 

## Requirements

 - PHP 5.3 or later
 - MediaWiki 1.23  or later
